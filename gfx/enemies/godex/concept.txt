```NEW ENEMY: GODEX 
/Ëˆgoh-decks/

 - A VERY powerful enemy who remains floating in place and is passive until a certain amount of DPS is dealt to him, where he will then enter his attack phase
 - Upon his attack phase, Godex releases a shockwave of divine fireballs with a semi-recognizable pattern
